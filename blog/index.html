      <h2><a href="https://jobsinthedesert.github.io/blog/cinemark_careers_bookmarklet/">Cinemark Careers Bookmarklet</a></h2>
	  <div class="content"><p>Cinemark has two locations in the valley.  The quickest way of searching for job opportunities at La Quinta and the River is to enter a zip code.  Here are the zip codes that will be used:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
<li>La Quinta: 92253</li>
<li>Rancho Mirage: 92270</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><img src="/img/cinemark_careers.PNG" alt="Cinemark Careers Search" /></p>

<p>Scrolling down to the career search area of the page, there is a form with an input element to enter the zip code and a button to click to search along with a few select elements that are not relevant.  The input element has an id of &ldquo;keyword&rdquo; and the value inside of it can be changed like so:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<pre><code>document.getElementById('keyword').value=92270;
</code></pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The submit button does not have an id and running the .submit() function on the form element does not work in this scenario because when a user clicks the button, the job search results are displayed on the page instead of refreshing the page with the results of the query.  To get around this, the button can be targeted using the document.forms[].elements[].click() method which would result in:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<pre><code>document.forms[0].elements[7].click();
</code></pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Put these two lines of code together and the template for the bookmarklet is formed.  After changing the zip code, the end result is two bookmarklets that will save a few keystrokes.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

      <h2><a href="https://jobsinthedesert.github.io/blog/mathis_brothers_bookmarklet/">Mathis Brothers Furniture Careers Bookmarklet</a></h2>
	  <div class="content"><p>There are plenty of ways to sort through the job opportunities at Mathis Brothers Furniture.  At the time of writing this post, there are not many positions available in the valley.  In fact, it makes me wonder if having this many job filters for furniture stores is overkill.  There are 27 degree filters and an even greater number of job categories.  I am tempted to create a job alert to see if there are any biotech or pharmaceutical job opportunities in the future.</p>

<p><img src="/img/mathis_brothers_search.PNG" alt="Mathis Brothers filters form" /></p>

<p>According to the site there are potentially three locations in the valley that are hiring.  There is Mathis Brothers in Indio and Mathis Sleep Center in Cathedral City and Palm Desert.  Realistically, there are two locations because according to Google and Yelp, the Palm Desert location is permanently closed.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Looking at the markup for the filters box pictured above we have a form with a lot of nested divs.  The divs for the filter types (Degree Type, Position Type, etc.) have dynamically generated ids.  This worried me because I thought it would make manipulating the form through javascript more difficult.  It turns out that even though those container divs have dynamic ids, the div elements containing the input tags have static ids that I am able to target.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<pre><code>&lt;input class=&quot;filterCheckbox smallMarginRight&quot; id=&quot;filters[locid][1865]&quot; value=&quot;1865&quot; type=&quot;checkbox&quot; aria-label=&quot;Mathis Brothers - Indio, California - Indio, CA, 92201&quot; name=&quot;filters[locid][1865]&quot;&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>After grabbing the ids for the different store locations, manipulating the form is a breeze.  The following is the code for the bookmarklet broken into multiple lines for readability.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<script src="//gist.github.com/jobsinthedesert/5dbfec52f5eeac99e9e0a8a9e2c277f7.js?file=mathis_brothers_bookmarklet.js"></script>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Input elements of type &lsquo;checkbox&rsquo; have a &lsquo;checked&rsquo; property that will either return true or false.  Setting the value to true will check the box on the page.  In this case the form is submitted with a submit button so submitting the form is straightforward as it can be targeted with an id.  Minifying the code, we end up with this bookmarklet.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<script src="//gist.github.com/jobsinthedesert/5dbfec52f5eeac99e9e0a8a9e2c277f7.js?file=mathis_brothers_bookmarklet-min.js"></script>

<p><a href="javascript:(function(){document.getElementById('filters[locid][1865]').checked=true;document.getElementById('filters[locid][1867]').checked=true;document.getElementById('filters[locid][1868]').checked=true;document.getElementById('filter-form').submit();})();">Mathis Brothers Furniture Careers Bookmarklet</a></p>
