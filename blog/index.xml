      <description>Cinemark has two locations in the valley. The quickest way of searching for job opportunities at La Quinta and the River is to enter a zip code. Here are the zip codes that will be used:
&amp;nbsp;
 La Quinta: 92253 Rancho Mirage: 92270  &amp;nbsp;
Scrolling down to the career search area of the page, there is a form with an input element to enter the zip code and a button to click to search along with a few select elements that are not relevant.</description>

      <guid>https://jobsinthedesert.github.io/blog/mathis_brothers_bookmarklet/</guid>
      <description>There are plenty of ways to sort through the job opportunities at Mathis Brothers Furniture. At the time of writing this post, there are not many positions available in the valley. In fact, it makes me wonder if having this many job filters for furniture stores is overkill. There are 27 degree filters and an even greater number of job categories. I am tempted to create a job alert to see if there are any biotech or pharmaceutical job opportunities in the future.</description>
